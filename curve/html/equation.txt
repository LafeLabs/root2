    Radius reduced by $\phi$ on every quarter turn.  One full turn takes T, so a quarter turn is $\frac{T}{4}$.  If we consider a quarter rotation starting at time $t_0$ and going to time $t_0 + \frac{T}{4}$ that should go down by $\phi$.  So  
    $$
    \frac{e^{-t_0/\tau}}{e^{-(t_0 + \frac{T}{4})/\tau}}=\phi
    $$
    $$
    e^{T/4\tau} = \phi
    $$
    $$
    \frac{T}{4\tau} = \ln{\phi}
    $$
    $$
    \tau = \frac{T}{4\ln{\phi}}
    $$
